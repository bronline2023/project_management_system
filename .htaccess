# This file is for Apache web servers to enable URL rewriting,

# Place this file in the root directory of your project (same level as index.php).

    # Base directory for the rewrite rules. Adjust this if your project is in a subfolder.
    # For example, if your project is at http://localhost/myproject/, set RewriteBase /myproject/
    RewriteBase /project_management_system/

    # Redirect requests for a non-existent file or directory to index.php.
    # The 'QSA' flag ensures that any existing query string parameters
    # (like '?page=dashboard&action=delete_task&id=X') are preserved and passed to index.php.
    # This rule assumes that all routing logic (determining which PHP file to include)
    # is handled within index.php based on the 'page' GET parameter.
